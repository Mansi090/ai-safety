Key Features
Incident Reporting: Easily report AI safety incidents with details.

Incident Dashboard: View, filter, and manage incidents.

Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.

Dynamic Navigation: Sidebar navigation updates based on the page.

Fuzzy Search: Quickly search incidents with typo-tolerance.

Custom Tags & Filtering: Organize incidents using custom tags.

Analytics: Visualize incident data using charts and graphs.


Design Decisions and Challenges
Design Simplicity: Chose Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and maintaining a clean, minimal UI.

Dynamic Routing: Used React Router to enable page-based navigation (Dashboard vs Add Incident).

Search Optimization: Integrated Fuse.js to allow fuzzy search for a better user experience without requiring exact matches.

State Management: Managed local state with React's built-in hooks to keep the project lightweight (avoided Redux unless scaling is needed).

Responsive Layout: Designed mobile-friendly layouts using Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities.

Challenge: Integrating real-time search highlighting and advanced tag-based filtering required careful optimization to avoid UI lag with larger datasets.
