## Design Decisions and Challenges

- **Design Simplicity**:  
  Chose **Tailwind CSS** for rapid prototyping and maintaining a clean, minimal UI.
  
- **Dynamic Routing**:  
  Used **React Router** to enable smooth page-based navigation (Dashboard vs Add Incident).

- **Search Optimization**:  
  Integrated **Fuse.js** to allow fuzzy search, improving the search experience without requiring exact matches.

- **State Management**:  
  Managed local state with **React's built-in hooks** to keep the project lightweight. (No Redux used unless needed for future scaling.)

- **Responsive Layout**:  
  Designed mobile-friendly layouts using **Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities** to ensure accessibility across devices.

- **Challenge**:  
  Integrating real-time search highlighting and advanced tag-based filtering required careful optimization to avoid UI lag with larger datasets.
